#### Console Function Module
Class Postman's visual editing of test data. Supports multiple test data requests at once, executes concurrently by default, and easily achieves concurrent testing.
- Definition domain: Interface definition management
- Running domain: Maintenance of interface dimension running data
- Data domain: Running data maintenance without relying on interface definitions
- Scenario domain: Free combination of interface data, reusable
- Data history domain: View historical execution of run data
- Scenario history domain: View historical execution of run scenarios

#### Management Function Module
Data created in the console can be viewed in the management domain, and documents can also be edited directly through the management domain for rapid writing and management.
- Dashboard: View various statistical data maintained by the system, e.g.: Distribution of interface types, Interface specification checks, Whether interfaces are automated, Recent 6-month execution distribution and trends, Interface statistical data for each application, etc.
- Console: Visualized maintenance of interface test data
- Use cases: Maintenance of use case information, and maintenance of imported use cases through Xmind
- Scenarios: Contains scenario lists and data lists, with scenarios consisting of one or more data
- Results: Record of execution results, including: Data test history, Scenario test history, etc.
- Tasks: Configurable one-time or scheduled task execution scenarios or data,关联不同环境即可实现场景或数据的跨环境复用，related to different environments to achieve cross-environment reuse of scenarios or data.
- Environments: Maintenance of authentication information, common parameter maintenance, etc., supports product and application dimension statistical reports view
- Files: Data storage is divided into two parts, management data is stored in MySQL, and execution history data is stored on the server, reducing MySQL queries and calls, faster speed, lighter storage.
- Description: System design and usage documentation
- Logs: Record of page operation logs
- Management: Maintenance of system user permissions

#### Data Sources
- Test data (automatically generated by the system + manually input)
- Fuzzy data (automatically generated)
- Variable provision (interface results, dependency provided, process variables visible)
