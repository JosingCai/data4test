#### Usage Example:
- Product List: Create a sample environment named "Sample Product."
- On the File-Test Case Management page: Import the test case file (Sample Product.xmind).
- Product List: Select the corresponding environment name, click to import test cases from Xmind. You can then see the corresponding test case data under the test case menu.

#### XMind File
- Demo: doc/file/project_V1.0.0_testcase_demo.xmind
- Field Descriptions:
    - Separated by an underscore "_".
    - The project name in XMind should match the project name entered in the test environment.
    - Version V1.0.0 is used to set the version to which the test case belongs, reflected through the case_id.
    - Module names in Chinese and English in the demo are separated by a hyphen "-", reflected through the case_id. If not set, it defaults to "other."
