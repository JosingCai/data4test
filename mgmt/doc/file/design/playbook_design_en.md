#### Playbook Composition
- N number of data files, combined as needed
- The same data file can be referenced repeatedly within the same scenario
- The same data file can be referenced repeatedly across different scenarios

#### Playbook Types
- Serial Interrupt: If any data case within the scenario fails, subsequent data cases will not be executed.
- Serial Comparison: After all data cases within the scenario are executed serially, the values of variables with the same name output from each data case are compared. The scenario passes if all values are equal.
- Serial Continue: If a data case fails during serial execution within the scenario, subsequent data cases continue to execute.
- Concurrent Normal: Data cases within the scenario are executed concurrently.
- Comparison Normal: After all data cases within the scenario are executed concurrently, the values of variables with the same name output from each data case are compared. The scenario passes if all values are equal.

#### Variable Passing
- Within the same scenario, data files executed later can seamlessly use output variables from previously executed data files.
- Global variables defined in system parameters
- Dedicated parameters in the environment

#### Playbook Execution Environment
- Can be associated with a single environment: for functional testing, performance testing, etc.
- Can be associated with multiple environments: for multi-environment testing in the information technology and innovation sector, allowing for execution across multiple environments simultaneously.
